## What's this for?
See the main repo for this project, [TouchFaders](https://github.com/theonlytechnohead/TouchFaders) for more details

## Where do it get this?
It's available on the [releases tab](../../releases/latest)!

It used to be on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.ddns.anderserver.touchfaders), but Google (incorrectly, unfairly) kicked me off.
