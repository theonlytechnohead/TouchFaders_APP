# TouchFaders app
OSC Android app for TouchFaders MIDI, using zerOSConf

## What's this for?
See the main repo for this project, [TouchFaders MIDI](https://github.com/theonlytechnohead/TouchFaders_MIDI) for more details

## Where do it get this? APK download?
Due to security issues (and because it'd be a pain for me to manage right now), there is no direct APK download.  
Instead, please clone the whole repository, and use Android Studio to generate your own APK and install it on your device.  
In the future, this might be available on the Play Store proper, but there's a bit of a way to go before then.
